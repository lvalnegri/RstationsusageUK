## Great Britain Rail Stations Usage (data and shiny app)

Annual estimates of the number of Entries/Exits (Totals plus Full/Reduced/Season tickets), and Interchanges at each Station in Great Britain.

The package includes the following tables:
- `stations` the list of all *current* live stations (2,568 as of 31-12-2022), with geographic and projected coordinates and related *Output Area*.
- `dataset` the `Total` counts for *Entry&Exit* passengers, also segmented by `Full`, `Reduced`, and `Season` tickets, and  `Interchanges` at bigger stations. The `Rank` and  `VarYoY`, or variation year on year, is also provided.
- `distances` the linear distance in meters between each pair of stations.

The package is not on `CRAN`. To install the package:
