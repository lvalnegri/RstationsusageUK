## Great Britain Rail Stations Usage

An $R$ package cotaining the annual estimates (by financial year since 1997/98) of the number of *Entries/Exits* (*Totals* plus *Full*/*Reduced*/*Season* tickets), and *Interchanges* at each Station in Great Britain.

The package is not on `CRAN`. To install the package:
```
remotes::install_github('lvalnegri/RstationsusageUK')
```

The package includes the following tables:
- `stations` the list of all *current* live stations (2,568 as of 31-12-2022), with geographic and projected coordinates and related *Output Area*.
- `dataset` the `Total` counts for *Entry&Exit* passengers, also segmented by `Full`, `Reduced`, and `Season` tickets, and  `Interchanges` at bigger stations. The `Rank` and  `VarYoY`, or variation year on year, is also provided.
- `distances` the linear distance in meters between each pair of stations.

All the above datasets are also provided in `csv` format in the `data-raw/csv` folder.

This is an early version containing only data.
